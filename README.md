# OpenSource-Practice
These Repository is made to help new learners create a Pull Request.

The learner has to fork this repo then add a program file of his choice.

(By that we mean, the learner has to add a program file such as Java/Python/C/any other language of which he has enjoyed a lot in writing code.)

Then the learner has to push the changes to his remote and then create a pull request to merge the code into this global repo.
